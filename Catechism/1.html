            <li> The preface of the Lord's prayer, which is, "Our Father which art in heaven," teacheth us to draw near to God
                with all holy reverence and confidence, as children to a father able and ready to help us; and that we should
                pray with and for others. </li>

            <li> In the second petition, which is, "Thy kingdom come," we pray that Satan's kingdom may be destroyed; and that
                the kingdom of grace may be advanced, ourselves and others brought into it, and kept in it; and that the
                kingdom of glory may be hastened. </li>

                would make us able and willing to know, obey and submit to his will in all things, as the angels do in heaven.

            <li> In the fifth petition, which is, "And forgive us our debts," as we forgive our debtors, we pray that God, for
                Christ's sake, would freely pardon all our sins; which we are the rather encouraged to ask, because by his
                grace we are enabled from the heart to forgive others. </li>

                would either keep us from being tempted to sin, or support and deliver us when we are tempted. </li>

            <li> The conclusion of the Lord's prayer, which is, "For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever,
                Amen," teacheth us to take our encouragement in prayer from God only, and in our prayers to praise him, ascribing
                kingdom, power and glory to him. And in testimony of our desire, and assurance to be heard, we say, "Amen."
